# Flow Finance Components

This app provides store components related to the [Flow Finance payment method](https://github.com/vtex-apps/flow-finance-payment): an account sign-up form and a promo message for the PDP.

:warning: The account sign-up form will not function unless the two [Flow Finance payment method](https://github.com/vtex-apps/flow-finance-payment) apps have been installed and configured (see instructions at link).

## Configuration

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) `vtex.flow-finance-components` in the desired account;
2. Upload a PDF containing the Terms & Conditions that shoppers must agree to when applying for a Flow Finance account to the location of your choice and make a note of the URL.
3. In the account's admin, access **Apps** and then select the **Flow Finance Components** box;
4. Input your `Store Name` and `Store-branded Payment Name`, as well as the URL of the `Terms & Conditions PDF` from step 2, and click Save;
5. Add this app as a dependency in your store-theme's `manifest.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "vtex.flow-finance-components": "0.x"
  }
```

This app creates a new store route: `/flow-finance`, which hosts the Flow Finance account sign-up form.

This app also provides a `flow-finance-promo-message` block which can be added to the PDP and accepts the following props:

| Prop name      | Type     | Description                                                | Default value |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `interestRate` | `number` | Interest rate for loan estimate calculation (1.5% = 0.015) | `0.0149`      |
| `installments` | `number` | Number of installments for loan estimate                   | `12`          |

This block also includes a link which, when clicked, will open the Flow Finance account sign-up form as a modal directly on the PDP. The link is only shown if a shopper is logged in, and if they do not have a Flow Finance account.
